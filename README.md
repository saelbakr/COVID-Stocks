# ANALYZING THE EFFECTS OF COVID-19 ON THE STOCK MARKET


## BACKGROUND

In March 2020, the stock market experienced one of the highest drops ever as a result of COVID-19.  In this project we collaborated to analyze the initial effects of Covid-19 to stocks of different industries such as Pharmaceuticals, Airline, Technology, and Oil and Gas companies.

## DATA
The data was sourced from Yahoo finance and Kaggle. Data was cleaned using python language.

## VISUALS
The visuals were completed using pandas and matplotlib python libraries. 

## RESULTS
There was a negative relationship in most Airline, Technology, and Oil and Gas companies that we analyzed. However, for Pharmaceuticals such as Clorox, there was definite positive relation between the rise of COVID-19 in the United States and its stock sales
